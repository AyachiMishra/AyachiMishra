I am an undergrad student of computer science engineering at IIT Delhi  - Abu dhabi. I love mathematics (specially probability and linear Algebra) and full stack system design. I have gained experience in machine learning specially in tools like pandas, numpy, scikit learn, tensorflow. My hobbies include playing with cats 😸 and football ⚽.

Recently, I have also executed projects involving Agentic AI to automate redundant workflows in full stack applications while also keeping guardrails to avoid automating important business decisions.
