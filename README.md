I am an undergrad student studying computer science engineering at IIT Delhi  - Abu dhabi. I love mathematics (specially probability and linear Algebra) and full stack system design. I have gained experience in machine learning specially in tools like pandas, numpy, scikit learn, tensorflow. My hobbies include playing with cats 😸 and football ⚽.

Recently, I have also executed projects involving Agentic AI to automate redundant workflows in full stack applications while also keeping guardrails to avoid automating important business decisions. Eg: [Project ADAN](https://github.com/AyachiMishra/Mashreq_Bank_Social_Intelligence_System_With_Agentic_Workflow)
